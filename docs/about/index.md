# About Me

## Hello!
Welcome to my online portfolio! I'm Alex, and I'm currently working as a freelance cartographer in my hometown of Dothan, Alabama, the Peanut Capital of the World. I graduated from the University of Alabama with my bachelor's degrees in Geography and History in 2018, and followed that up with my master's in Geography at UA in 2020. 

Like a lot of cartographers, my interest in the field started out as crumpling up pieces of paper to create "topographic" relief and using Microsoft Paint to draw out very crude maps of worlds and alternate realities that played out in my head. I originally went to college wanting to be either an urban planner or a history teacher. As luck would have it, though, a Geography professor for one of my required classes liked my work and offered me a job in UA's Cartographic Research Lab. I was immediately hooked by the world of cartography, and I haven't looked back since.

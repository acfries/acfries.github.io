# About Me

## Hello!
Welcome to my online portfolio! I'm Alex, and I'm currently a second-year graduate student at The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, AL. I'm going for my Master's degree in Geography at the moment, and my primary focuses are cartography, GIS, and historical geography. My thesis tries to bridge all three of these together by taking various geographic variables related to the state of Alabama and correlating those with urban populations in the state over the course of its history, then using those findings to create a map that tells the story of urbanization and its primary drivers in Alabama. 

Like a lot of cartographers, my interest in the field started out as crumpling up pieces of paper to create "topographic" relief and using Microsoft Paint to draw out very crude maps of worlds and alternate realities that played out in my head. I originally went to college wanting to be either an urban planner or a history teacher. As luck would have it, though, a Geography professor for one of my required classes liked my work and offered me a job in UA's Cartographic Research Lab. I was immediately hooked by the world of cartography, and I haven't looked back since.
